# bigDataHw
This project is done due to BigData Course HomeWork.
I was supposed to use nifi to read  xml files of hamshahri archive for 10 years   , extract keyword of news title and then put in elastic search .template of  my nifi project is uploaded as hamshahri.xml .
For extracting keyword I developed a python service which you  can find its code in main.py
In this service: flask library is used for creating web service,hazm library is used to get stopword list of persian language,finally sklearn is used for feature extraction.
